# Loop Box Dashboard - Updates & Fixes

## Latest Updates (Phase 2.2 - CRITICAL FIX)

### 🔧 Auto-Cascade Bug Fix

**Problem:** Auto-cascade was enabled but Year 2 & 3 weren't updating from Year 1 changes.

**Root Cause:**
- The cascade code ran AFTER widgets were rendered
- Year 2/3 widgets were overwriting cascaded values with widget state
- Timing issue between session state updates and widget rendering

**Solution Implemented:**
1. ✅ Moved cascade logic to run BEFORE tabs are created
2. ✅ Made Year 2 & 3 inputs **read-only** (disabled) when auto-cascade is ON
3. ✅ Added warning message: "Year 2 & 3 tabs are read-only (auto-calculated from Year 1)"
4. ✅ Fixed Plotly version debug error

**How It Works Now:**
- When auto-cascade is **OFF**: All years are editable independently
- When auto-cascade is **ON**:
  - Year 1 is editable
  - Year 2 & 3 tabs are read-only (greyed out)
  - Year 2 & 3 values automatically update from Year 1
  - Warning message shows at top of sidebar

**Cascading Logic:**
- Container Price: -3% per year
- Monthly Fee: Same in Y2, +10% in Y3
- Per-Use Fee: Same across all years
- Wash Cost: -8% in Y2, -9% in Y3
- Collection Cost: -10% in Y2, -11% in Y3
- Volume & OpEx: NOT cascaded (different scale per year)

### 🔧 Bug Fixes

#### 1. **Visualization Issues Fixed**
- ✅ Added error handling for all Plotly charts

### ✨ New Features

#### 3. **Auto-Cascade Year Values**
**Problem Solved:** Previously, you had to manually adjust Year 2 and Year 3 when changing Year 1.

**Solution:** New "Auto-cascade Year 1 to Year 2 & 3" checkbox in Settings!

**How It Works:**
When enabled, Year 1 changes automatically flow to Years 2 & 3 with these adjustments:

**Pricing:**
- Container Price: -3% per year (economies of scale)
- Monthly Fee: Same in Y2, +10% in Y3 (value increase)
- Per-Use Fee: Same across all years
- Deposit: Same across all years

**COGS (Cost Improvements):**
- Wash Cost: -8% in Y2, another -9% in Y3 (efficiency gains)
- Collection Cost: -10% in Y2, another -11% in Y3 (route optimization)
- Container Cost: Same across years
- Container Lifespan: Same across years

**How to Use:**
1. Go to sidebar → ⚙️ Settings
2. Check "Auto-cascade Year 1 to Year 2 & 3"
3. Now adjust only Year 1 values
4. Year 2 & 3 update automatically with growth rates!

**When to Use:**
- ✅ Quick scenario modeling
- ✅ When you want consistent scaling
- ✅ Testing pricing strategies

**When NOT to Use:**
- ❌ When Years 2 & 3 have unique changes (partnerships, new products)
- ❌ When you need precise manual control per year

### 📝 Streamlit Cloud Auto-Deploy

**Question:** Does Streamlit redeploy when I push changes?

**Answer:** ✅ **YES! Automatically.**

**How It Works:**
1. You push code to GitHub
2. Streamlit Cloud detects the commit (within seconds)
3. Automatic rebuild starts
4. New version deploys in 1-2 minutes
5. Your dashboard URL updates automatically

**To Monitor:**
- Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- Click on your app
- See "Build Logs" for real-time deployment status
- Green checkmark = Deployed successfully

**Pro Tips:**
- Wait 1-2 minutes after pushing before testing changes
- Check build logs if something breaks
- Use `requirements.txt` for new packages (auto-installed)

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

#### Charts Not Showing?

**Try These Steps:**

1. **Enable Debug Mode:**
   - Sidebar → Settings → Check "Debug Mode"
   - Look for error messages under charts
   - Check Plotly version in debug panel

2. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - Or open in incognito/private window

3. **Check Build Logs:**
   - Go to Streamlit Cloud dashboard
   - Click your app → "Build logs"
   - Look for errors during deployment

4. **Verify Requirements:**
   - Make sure `requirements.txt` includes:
     ```
     streamlit>=1.28.0
     pandas>=2.0.0
     plotly>=5.17.0
     openpyxl>=3.1.0
     kaleido==0.2.1
     ```

#### Common Issues:

**"Chart not rendering"**
- Check if data calculations are working (Debug Mode)
- Verify Year 1/2/3 have valid numbers
- Try disabling auto-cascade temporarily

**"Streamlit not redeploying"**
- Check that you pushed to the correct branch
- Wait 2-3 minutes (can take longer during high traffic)
- Check if build failed in Streamlit Cloud logs

**"Variables not cascading"**
- Make sure "Auto-cascade" checkbox is CHECKED
- Try toggling it off and on
- Check Year 1 values are set

### 📊 File Changes

**Modified Files:**
- `app.py`: Added auto-cascade logic, debug mode, error handling
- `requirements.txt`: Added `kaleido==0.2.1` for chart rendering
- `UPDATES.md`: This file (documentation)

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All existing features still work
- Saved scenarios remain compatible
- Default behavior unchanged (auto-cascade OFF by default)

### 🚀 Next Steps

**To Deploy These Fixes:**

```bash
# 1. Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix visualizations and add auto-cascade feature"

# 2. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 3. Wait 1-2 minutes for Streamlit Cloud to redeploy

```

**To Test Locally:**

```bash
